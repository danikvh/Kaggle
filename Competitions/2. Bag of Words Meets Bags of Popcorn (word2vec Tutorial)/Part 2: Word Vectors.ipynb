    "This part of the tutorial will focus on using distributed word vectors created by the Word2Vec algorithm. (For an overview of deep learning, as well as pointers to some additional tutorials, see the \"What is Deep Learning?\" page).\n",
    "\n",
    "Parts 2 and 3 assume more familiarity with Python than Part 1. We developed the following code on a dual-core Macbook Pro, however, we have not yet run the code successfully on Windows. If you are a Windows user and you get it working, please leave a note on how you did it in the forum! For more detail, see the \"Setting Up Your System\" page.\n",
    "\n",
    "Word2vec, published by Google in 2013, is a neural network implementation that learns distributed representations for words. Other deep or recurrent neural network architectures had been proposed for learning word representations prior to this, but the major problem with these was the long time required to train the models. Word2vec learns quickly relative to other models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Word2Vec does not need labels in order to create meaningful representations. This is useful, since most data in the real world is unlabeled. If the network is given enough training data (tens of billions of words), it produces word vectors with intriguing characteristics. Words with similar meanings appear in clusters, and clusters are spaced such that some word relationships, such as analogies, can be reproduced using vector math. The famous example is that, with highly trained word vectors, \"king - man + woman = queen.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Check out Google's code, writeup, and the accompanying papers. This presentation is also helpful. The original code is in C, but it has since been ported to other languages, including Python. We encourage you to play with the original C tool, but be warned that it is not user-friendly if you are a beginning programmer (we had to manually edit the header files to compile it).\n",
    "\n",
    "Recent work out of Stanford has also applied deep learning to sentiment analysis; their code is available in Java. However, their approach, which relies on sentence parsing, cannot be applied in a straightforward way to paragraphs of arbitrary length.\n",
    "\n",
    "Distributed word vectors are powerful and can be used for many applications, particularly word prediction and translation. Here, we will try to apply them to sentiment analysis."

    "Although Word2Vec does not require graphics processing units (GPUs) like many deep learning algorithms, it is compute intensive. Both Google's version and the Python version rely on multi-threading (running multiple processes in parallel on your computer to save time). ln order to train your model in a reasonable amount of time, you will need to install cython (instructions here). Word2Vec will run without cython installed, but it will take days to run instead of minutes."
